# Project 0

Francesco Seraghiti

This is the beginning of a personal cv website

index.html is the landing page with main image, name and a small text about me

portfolio.html will store all the link to my personal projects (perhaps many form this course)

education.html stores in a table the list of my academic experiences

experience.html stores in a table the list of my professional experiences

contacts.html is where users can find and click on my contacts


all pages have a responsive navigation menu showing the active page

on the bottom there is a footer with links to my social profiles
